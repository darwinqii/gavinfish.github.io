# DRFish Blog

This is my blog based on github page, you can also visit it at [http://www.drfish.me](http://www.drfish.me).

I use [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) architecture since it is easy and I can customize my own future.My basic style is [Clean Blog](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll).

Here are some new features added by me:

## Commet

I use [duoshuo](http://duoshuo.com/) system as my commet system, since it is not user-friendly to use disqus in China.

## Side Bar

I add a side bar to show personal information on the home page, including a little head portrait, SNS links.

## Flag clouds

I use a dynamic clounds to show my flags of posts. You can click on the mark or single flag tag to jump to my flag pase.

Milestone page is a place to show what I have done. It includes companies I have served and my portfilio.
